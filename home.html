        <h2 class="subhead-text">About</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">I created this website for a place to upload the various activities and worksheets I have created while working as an ALT in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan so that other teachers can use them or get ideas from them to use in their own classes.<br>
        As such, this website will continually be a work in progress and new pages and documents will be added periodically. If there is currently no link to a speicifc unit/part of a unit, then I have not yet made an activity for that lesson.<br>
        <br>
        Regarding the elementary school lessons (Let's Try 1/2, and We Can 1/2), I have not started working at an elementary school yet this year so I currently have no activities or documents created for these textbooks. Once I have started creating worksheets for these classes I will begin uploading.<br>
        However, I am primarily based in a Junior High so this website will primarily be focused on that level.</p>

                            <li>Decided to remove the Let's Try and We Can pages as I have not had to create any lesson plans or activities for elementary schools, as such I have no information to add to these pages.</li>
