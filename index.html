        <h2 class="subhead-text">About</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px">I created this website for a place to upload the various New Horizon activities and worksheets I have created while working as an assistant language teacher (ALT) in Miyagi Prefecture in Japan so that other teachers can use them or get ideas from them to use in their own classes. As the school I work at uses the New Horizon textbook, my worksheet order is based around the order followed within that textbook.<br>
        As such, this website will continually be a work in progress and new pages and documents will be added periodically. If there is currently no link to a speicifc unit/part of a unit, then I have not yet made an activity for that New Horizon lesson, however in the future something will get added. As such I will post links to updated and/or newly created pages on the update section of this front page.<br>
        <br>
        If you have any specific requests for a part of a unit that has not been added, or if there are any bugs/formatting errors regarding the website or the pdf's found within it, feel free to drop me a message through the contact tab on the left. Any suggestions are also welcomed.<br>
